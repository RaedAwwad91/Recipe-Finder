Welcome to Recipe Finder V2! This tool allows you to find recipes based on a single ingredient, with the added feature of sensitivity filters.

## Features

- **Ingredient-Based Search:** Enter a single ingredient, and the tool will provide you with a list of recipes containing that ingredient.
  
- **Sensitivity Filters (New in V2):** Added filters to cater to different sensitivities, allowing users to find recipes that match specific dietary requirements.
